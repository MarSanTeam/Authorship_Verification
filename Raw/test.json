    "r Dr <addr10_SN>, <nl><nl> <nl><nl>I am currently a student going into my second year and I study <course>. During the Covid-19 lockdown and the summer break, unfortunate personal events occurred. <nl><nl> <nl><nl>Currently, I have a job 4 days a week and only for 4 hours to support myself financially. Unfortunately, my work timetable clashes with the online live webinar that you hold on <day>s between 1 PM and 2 PM for the module <nl><nl>I am a hard-working student and University is one of the ways I use to relax from work and personal life. <nl>I am hoping that this term I am okay to not be present live in these webinars. However, I will catch up on them either after work or the day after and complete all the notes and reading for them. I am in constant communication with several students from the class and I assume a recording of the webinar will be online to look at also. <nl><nl>Therefore, I will not be missing out any of the work or discussions to be made. <nl><nl>Also, if you would like to be updated of my personal module progress I will gladly be able to always email the work to you not to necessarily check or mark but just to show that I am not missing live webinars purposely. <nl><nl> <nl><nl>I hope this is okay with you. <nl><nl> <nl><nl><part_FN_IN_SN><nl><nl><student_number><nl><nl><course><new>Thank you for your reply. <nl><nl><part_FN_IN_SN><new>Dear Dr <addr7_SN>,<nl><nl>Unfortunately I am not in <city> until <month>. As I mentioned before about the personal circumstances I emailed the director of <subject> in advance about my situation and asked if it was okay that I didn’t attend campus in person and I was given permission to do so till <month>.<nl><nl>Are there any other webinars available at other times ? <nl><nl>I am sorry to disturb you during your break .<nl><nl><part_FN_IN_SN><new>Thank you <nl>Honestly I appreciate it so much.<nl>I will keep you updated with my notes so you know I am doing the work. <nl>And hopefully I might be able to work around my shifts and attend the live seminars.<nl>Thank you once again.<nl><nl><part_FN_IN_SN>",
